# Basic-Portfolio
My Portfolio

This is my first README. This is the HTML/CSS source code for my portfolio. This is the first webpage that I have made from scratch. So don't 
be too harsh on me. Enjoy, and please feel free to give me constructive criticism.

Some things that I had an issue with was floats would not work properly for me. Some situations they would work when I floated all left, or 
sometimes when I would display: inline-block;, and other times they would not work. I need some more clarity on the best practive to make them 
work together and cleanly.

Would Flexbox or Template Layouts work better?
Does the bootstrap that we have been talking about make this easier?
